        "**PART 1 INSTRUCTIONS:** You are an educational researcher interested in comparing different methods for teaching data science to undergraduate students. There are three different methods you are interested in comparing: (1) Direct Instruction (traditional method); (2) Inquiry-Based Learning (teacher facilitates student problem solving); (3) Collaborative Learning (students working in small groups). To compare these methods, you decide to randomly recruit undergraduate data science students to be part of a workshop on hypothesis testing basics. Students will be randomly assigned to one of three workshops, where each workshop employs a different teaching method. At the end of the workshop, students will be given a 50-question quiz where their understanding of hypothesis testing will be assessed. Percentage scores on this quiz serve as the outcome of interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, it would be apparent that the prior level of knowledge a student possess about hypothesis testing may serve as a potential confounding variable that you would want to control for. Thus, the Prior Knowledge a given student has about hypothesis testing is categorized into \"High\" and \"Low\". The data from this experiment are contained in the `Data Science Teaching Method.xlsx` file. With these data, your tasks are:\n",

        "**Question 3.** Specify the independent variable and blocking factor. What are some possible lurking variables?\n",
        "\n",
        "The independent variables are three types of teaching methods, collaborative, direct instruction and inquiry based learning. Blocking factor is prior knowledge (low/High) and the lurking variables are age,  academic acheivment and demographic factors.\n",

        "Randomized block would distribute out the prior knowledge low and high evenly throughout the three types of teaching methods. A completly randomized design woiuld not distribute prior knowledge evenly and so you may not get an even balance and so some results maybe skewed and we would not get a fair comparision.  \n",
